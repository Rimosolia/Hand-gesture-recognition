# Hand-gesture-recognition

### Objective
Build hand gesture recognition model from scratch.

### CNN Model
We implement VGG16 architecture for solving the problem. You can read the concept on [Paper](https://paperswithcode.com/method/vgg-16) or our report.

### Provided
Documents folder - All the concept that we researched and make a report about them.
dataset.py - Code used for creating dataset (input images)
export.py - Code implemented VGG16, train and export to pretrained model
running.py - Code used for running the pretrained model and detecting hand gesture through your camera.
